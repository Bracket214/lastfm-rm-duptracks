[What's this?]

This is a javascript that semi-automatically removes duplicated
listened tracks (scrobbles) on the Last.fm web site. The aim of
this script is to address the defect that the Last.fm client on
Mac OS X sometimes accidentally sends scrobbles that were already
sent in the past for some reasons.

[Requirement]

- Firefox
  http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/

- Greasemonkey addon of Firefox
  https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748

[Installation]

1. Install Firefox and Greasemonkey and setup them. (You may need
   just installing them.)

2. Click the below link, and then you see the popup for installation.
   http://github.com/peo3/lastfm-rm-duptracks/blob/master/lastfm_remove_duplicated.user.js
   Click "install".

[How to use]

1. Login to the Last.fm and go the 'Recently Listened Tracks' page,
   i.g., http://www.last.fm/user/<your_id>/tracks .

2. If the page includes duplicated tracks, then starts to remove them.
   Once any duplicated tracks have removed and all duplicated tracks
   run out, the script reloads the page to load older tracks. Therefore,
   while duplicated tracks are loaded by reloading the page, the script
   automatically removes them until the page includes no duplicated
   tracks.

3. Otherwise, it shows a popup, 'No duplicated track found' and does
   nothing. You want to remove older tracks, you need to jump to the
   next page by yourself. This is the reason that the script is NOT
   fully automated.

[Important Notice]

This script identifies duplicated tracks as whether a listened date is
identical or not. Sadly, the Last.fm client normally sends tracks
that have an identical date. This seems due to the limitation of iPod
devices that store a track that is listened multiple times with only
last listened date and number of times.

Therefore, DON'T use this script for such normal situation and use it
ONLY when you clearly know that duplicated tracks are sent for some
reason. I strongly recommend that turns this script off by default
to avoid removing innocent tracks by mistake.
